#### AFINN-based sentiment analysis for dart

Sentiment is a dart package that uses the  [AFINN-165](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010)  wordlist and  [Emoji Sentiment Ranking](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144296)  to perform  [sentiment analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis)  on arbitrary blocks of input text. Sentiment provides several things:

-   Performance (see benchmarks below)
-   The ability to append and overwrite word / value pairs from the AFINN wordlist
-   The ability to easily add support for new languages
-   The ability to easily define custom strategies for negation, emphasis, etc. on a per-language basis
    Some `inline code`.

## Installation
Add this line to your pubspec.yaml and run `flutter pub get` command to activate the package
```
dependencies:
	dart_sentiment: ^0.0.1
```

## Example
```dart
import 'package:dart_sentiment/dart_sentiment.dart';

void main() {

final sentiment = Sentiment();

print(sentiment.analysis(

'i love dart',

));

print(sentiment.analysis('i hate you piece of shit ðŸ’©'));

print(sentiment.analysis('i hate you piece of shit ðŸ’©', emoji: true));

print(sentiment.analysis('ti odio un pezzo di merda ðŸ’©',

languageCode: LanguageCode.italian));

print(sentiment.analysis('ti odio un pezzo di merda ðŸ’©',

emoji: true, languageCode: LanguageCode.italian));

print(sentiment.analysis('je te dÃ©teste merde ðŸ’©',

languageCode: LanguageCode.french));

print(sentiment.analysis('je te dÃ©teste merde ðŸ’©',

emoji: true, languageCode: LanguageCode.french));

}
```
### Function defination
Param | Description
-------- | -----
`String text` | Input phrase to analyze
`bool emoji = false` | Input emoji is present in the phrase to analyze
`LanguageCode languageCode = LanguageCode.english` |Language to use for sentiment analysis. ` LanguageCode { english, italian, french, german }`

## How it works

### [](https://github.com/thisandagain/sentiment#afinn)AFINN

AFINN is a list of words rated for valence with an integer between minus five (negative) and plus five (positive). Sentiment analysis is performed by cross-checking the string tokens (words, emojis) with the AFINN list and getting their respective scores. The comparative score is simply:  `sum of each token / number of tokens`. So for example let's take the following:

`I love cats, but I am allergic to them.`

That string results in the following:
```dart
{
    score: 1,
    comparative: 0.1111111111111111,
    calculation: [ { allergic: -2 }, { love: 3 } ],
    tokens: [
        'i',
        'love',
        'cats',
        'but',
        'i',
        'am',
        'allergic',
        'to',
        'them'
    ],
    words: [
        'allergic',
        'love'
    ],
    positive: [
        'love'
    ],
    negative: [
        'allergic'
    ]
}
```
-   Returned Objects
    -   **Score**: Score calculated by adding the sentiment values of recognized words.
    -   **Comparative**: Comparative score of the input string.
    -   **Calculation**: An array of words that have a negative or positive valence with their respective AFINN score.
    -   **Token**: All the tokens like words or emojis found in the input string.
    -   **Words**: List of words from input string that were found in AFINN list.
    -   **Positive**: List of positive words in input string that were found in AFINN list.
    -   **Negative**: List of negative words in input string that were found in AFINN list.

In this case, love has a value of 3, allergic has a value of -2, and the remaining tokens are neutral with a value of 0. Because the string has 9 tokens the resulting comparative score looks like:  `(3 + -2) / 9 = 0.111111111`

This approach leaves you with a mid-point of 0 and the upper and lower bounds are constrained to positive and negative 5 respectively (the same as each token!  ðŸ˜¸). For example, let's imagine an incredibly "positive" string with 200 tokens and where each token has an AFINN score of 5. Our resulting comparative score would look like this:

```
(max positive score * number of tokens) / number of tokens
(5 * 200) / 200 = 5
```
