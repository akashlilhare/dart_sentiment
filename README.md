#### AFINN-based sentiment analysis for dart

Dart Sentiment is a dart package that uses  
the  [AFINN-165](https://github.com/fnielsen/afinn/blob/master/afinn/data/AFINN-en-165.txt)  
wordlist  
and  [Emoji Sentiment Ranking](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144296)  
to perform  [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis)  on arbitrary  
blocks of input text. Dart Sentiment provides several things:
- Provide Language support for English, Italian, French and German.
- Provide support for various emojis.
- Based on analysis of text, provide an integer value in the range -n to +n (see details below)

## Installation
add following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`
```yaml  
  
dependencies:    
   dart_sentiment: <latest-version>  
   
 ```   
## Example
```dart

 import 'package:dart_sentiment/dart_sentiment.dart';    
 void main() {
 
	 final sentiment = Sentiment();    
    
	 print(sentiment.analysis("The cake she made was terrible üòê"));    
    
	 print(sentiment.analysis("The cake she made was terrible üòê", emoji: true));    
    
	 print(sentiment.analysis("I love cats, but I am allergic to them.",));    
    
	 print(sentiment.analysis("J'adore les chats, mais j'y suis allergique.",    
	 languageCode: LanguageCode.french));    
    
	print(sentiment.analysis("Le g√¢teau qu'elle a fait √©tait horrible üòê",    
	emoji: true, languageCode: LanguageCode.french)); 

}  

```
### Function defination
Param | Description
-------- | ----- 
`String text` | Input phrase to analyze
`bool emoji = false` | Input emoji is present in the phrase to analyze
`LanguageCode languageCode = LanguageCode.english` |Language to use for sentiment analysis. ` LanguageCode { english, italian, french, german }`

## How it works

### AFINN

AFINN is a list of words rated for valence with an integer between minus five (negative) and plus  
five (positive). Sentiment analysis is performed by cross-checking the string tokens (words, emojis)  
with the AFINN list and getting their respective scores. The comparative score is  
simply:  `sum of each token / number of tokens`. So for example let's take the following:

`I love cats, but I am allergic to them.`

That string results in the following:

```dart
{
    score: 1,
	comparative: 0.1111111111111111,
    tokens: [    
       "i",    
       "love",    
       "cats",    
       "but",    
       "i",    
       "am",    
       "allergic",    
       "to",    
       "them"    
    ],
    positive: [[love, 3]], 
    negative: [[allergic, 2]]
} 
``` 
- Returned Objects
  - **Score**: Score calculated by adding the sentiment values of recognized words.
  - **Comparative**: Comparative score of the input string.
  - **Token**: All the tokens like words or emojis found in the input string.
  - **Words**: List of words from input string that were found in AFINN list.
  - **Positive**: List of positive words in input string that were found in AFINN list.
  - **Negative**: List of negative words in input string that were found in AFINN list.

In this case, love has a value of 3, allergic has a value of -2, and the remaining tokens are  
neutral with a value of 0. Because the string has 9 tokens the resulting comparative score looks  
like:  `(3 + -2) / 9 = 0.111111111`

This approach leaves you with a mid-point of 0 and the upper and lower bounds are constrained to  
positive and negative 5 respectively. For example, let's imagine an incredibly "positive" string  
with 200 tokens and where each token has an AFINN score of 5. Our resulting comparative score would  
look like this:

``` (max positive score * number of tokens) / number of tokens (5 * 200) / 200 = 5 ```
